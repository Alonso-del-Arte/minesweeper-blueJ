# MineSweeper

The familiar game of clearing land mines.

I've been curious about BlueJ, a lightweight integrated development environment 
(IDE) for Java and Stride.

I started this project in Apache NetBeans 11.2, where I have almost completed 
`ui.text.Game`. As I still have plenty of other NetBeans projects, I figure I 
can copy this one over to BlueJ, I'll work on `ui.graphical.Game`.

Since BlueJ has JUnit 5 integration and NetBeans 11.2 doesn't, I had to upgrade 
the JUnit tests.
